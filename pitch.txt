Problem
	Lots of reviews coming from lots of places. 
		Lots of reviews not fully analyzed.

	Gives brand with products nationally or internationally the ability to see how popular their products are in a given geographical location.

	Would be interesting so see what areas prefer what types of producs
	One way of looking at reviews is to sort them by locations
 
 - Attacking reviews/UGC from location angle

Use of the app
	1. To be used by brands to target a location where some of their most popular product might not be 'hot'.
	2. This is a tool for the markets on clients end to use and analyze what kind of reviews are coming in by geo location
	3. App used by shoppers to find out what is 'hot' in their area

Demo:
1. show review across globe
	> Select Category
	> Select Procuct
	> Show markers
	> Show table
	> Zoom and show change
	> Use "find me" and/or "serach again" button
