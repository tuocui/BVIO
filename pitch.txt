Problem
	Lots of reviews coming from lots of places. 
		Lots of reviews not fully analyzed.


	Would be interesting so see what areas prefer what types of producs
	One way of looking at reviews is to sort them by locations
 
 - Attacking reviews/UGC from location angle

Use of the app
	1. This is a tool for the markets on clients end to use and analyze what kind of reviews are coming in by geo location
	2. **** App used by shoppers to find out what is 'hot' in their area

Demo:
1. show review across globe
	> Select Category
	> Select Procuct
	> Show markers
	> Show table
	> Zoom and show change
	> Use "find me" and/or "serach again" button

Demo story:
"how many people in this room use some kind of hair product?"
"Ever wonder what the most popular <Hair product> is in NA? or even Austin?"
<demo>

Questions:
- markers displayed on first page load?
- default category/product?
